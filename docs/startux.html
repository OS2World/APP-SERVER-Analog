    <h1><img src="analogo.gif" alt=""> Analog 6.0: Starting to use
      analog on other platforms</h1>
    <hr noshade="noshade" size="2"> Here is the really short summary:
    <ol>
      <li>Edit <kbd>anlghead.h</kbd> and compile, if necessary </li>
      <li>Edit <kbd>analog.cfg</kbd> </li>
      <li>Run analog </li>
    </ol>
    <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"> Many platforms have a precompiled
    version of analog available. Before compiling analog, have a look at
    the <a href="http://www.analog.cx/">analog home page</a> to see if
    yours does.
    <p> If you're not using one of the platforms for which a precompiled
      version is available, you'll have to compile your own version from
      the source. But don't worry -- it's written in standard C
      throughout, so it will compile out of the box on most platforms.
      (The source code is the same for all platforms.) </p>
    <p> First, change to the <kbd>src/</kbd> directory. </p>
    <p> Then look at the file anlghead.h, and see if there's anything
      you want to edit. </p>
    <p> When you have done that, you need to compile the program. How to
      do that depends on which operating system you're using. </p>
    <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"> <b><a name="compileux">Compiling
        under Unix</a></b>. First edit anlghead.h as described above.
    Then just type
    <pre>make
</pre>
    within the <kbd>src/</kbd> directory to compile the program. On
    most systems, that will be sufficient, and the compiled program
    should appear in the parent directory. If it fails to compile, have
    a look in the Makefile to see if there's anything that you need to
    change to suit your configuration, and try again. It says in that
    file what to do. In particular, <b>Solaris 2 (SunOS 5+)</b> users
    need to change the <kbd>LIBS=</kbd> line.
    <p> (Experts can pass some arguments in on the <kbd>make</kbd>
      command line instead of by editing <kbd>anlghead.h</kbd>: e.g. </p>
    <pre>make DEFS='-DLANGDIR=\"/usr/etc/apache/analog/lang/\"'
</pre>
    This is useful if you have a script to compile analog.)
    <p> If you haven't got gcc, you will need to change the compiler -
      try acc or cc instead. </p>
    <p> <b><a name="compileVMS">Compiling under OpenVMS</a></b>. You
      can find OpenVMS build scripts within the <kbd>src/build</kbd>
      directory. Unzip them within the <kbd>src</kbd> directory. Then
      to build Analog interactively from the command line, type </p>
    <pre>$ @ Build_Analog
</pre>
    or to submit the Build_Analog procedure to a batch queue, type
    <pre>$ Submit /NoPrint /Keep Batch.com
</pre>
    The command procedure will use MMS (or MMK) if it is available,
    otherwise it will compile everything from raw command procedures.
    <p> <b><a name="compileRiscOS">Compiling under Acorn RiscOS</a></b>.
      The Makefile can be found in the <kbd>src/build</kbd> directly,
      although at this point it has not been updated for version 5 of
      analog. You will have to make directories called <kbd>C</kbd>, <kbd>H</kbd>
      and <kbd>O</kbd>, and move the sources files into the appropriate
      directories: e.g., <kbd>alias.c</kbd> must be renamed <kbd>C.alias</kbd>.
      And you will find that there are some filenames in the header file
      <kbd>anlghead.h</kbd> that you want to change to fit into the
      RiscOS directory structure. </p>
    <p> <b><a name="compileOS2">Compiling under OS/2</a></b>. To
      compile analog for OS/2, you will need gcc, which may be installed
      via yum or whichever other method you choose. You should edit the
      Makefile to have <kbd>OS=OS2</kbd> and <kbd>LIBS=-lsocket</kbd>.
      In addition, modify the following lines<br>
    </p>
    <pre>bzip2: ALWAYS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd bzip2 &amp;&amp; $(MAKE) 'CC=$(CC)' 'ALLCFLAGS=$(ALLCFLAGS)'<br><br>libgd: ALWAYS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd libgd &amp;&amp; $(MAKE) 'CC=$(CC)' 'ALLCFLAGS=$(ALLCFLAGS)'<br><br>libpng: ALWAYS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd libpng &amp;&amp; $(MAKE) 'CC=$(CC)' 'ALLCFLAGS=$(ALLCFLAGS)'<br><br>pcre: ALWAYS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd pcre &amp;&amp; $(MAKE) 'CC=$(CC)' 'ALLCFLAGS=$(ALLCFLAGS)'<br><br>unzip: ALWAYS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd unzip &amp;&amp; $(MAKE) 'CC=$(CC)' 'ALLCFLAGS=$(ALLCFLAGS)'<br><br>zlib: ALWAYS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd zlib &amp;&amp; $(MAKE) 'CC=$(CC)' 'ALLCFLAGS=$(ALLCFLAGS)'</pre>
    <p>to read<br>
    </p>
    <pre>bzip2: ALWAYS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd bzip2 &amp;&amp; $(MAKE)<br><br>libgd: ALWAYS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd libgd &amp;&amp; $(MAKE)<br><br>libpng: ALWAYS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd libpng &amp;&amp; $(MAKE)<br><br>pcre: ALWAYS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd pcre &amp;&amp; $(MAKE)<br><br>unzip: ALWAYS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd unzip &amp;&amp; $(MAKE)<br><br>zlib: ALWAYS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd zlib &amp;&amp; $(MAKE)<br></pre>
    <p>(removing references to the CC and ALLCFLAGS variables).<br>
    </p>
    <p>Then, just type </p>
    <pre>make
</pre>
    to generate the analog.exe executable.
    <hr noshade="noshade" size="1"> After you've compiled the program,
    leave the <kbd>src/</kbd> directory and then just type
    <pre>analog
</pre>
    to run the program. (Or <kbd>./analog</kbd> if for some reason <kbd>.</kbd>
    isn't in your <kbd>$PATH</kbd>.)
    <p> You can configure analog by putting commands in the
      configuration file, which is called <kbd>analog.cfg</kbd> by
      default. Two commands you will need straight away are </p>
    <pre>LOGFILE logfilename      # to set where your logfile lives
OUTFILE outputfile.html  # to send the output to a file instead of the screen
</pre>
    The logfile must be stored locally -- analog won't use FTP or HTTP
    to fetch it from the internet. There's a sample logfile supplied
    with the program. For help in interpreting the output, see <cite><a
        href="meaning.html">What the results mean</a></cite>.
    <p> There are already some configuration commands to get you started
      in the configuration file, but there are lots of others available.
      You can find the most common ones in the section on <a
        href="basiccmd.html">basic commands</a> later in the Readme, and
      you can read about all of them in the section on <a
        href="custom.html">customising analog</a>. There are also some
      sample configuration files in the examples directory. </p>
    <p> There is one other way to give options to analog, via command
      line arguments, given on the command line after the program name.
      These are just shortcuts for configuration file commands. </p>
